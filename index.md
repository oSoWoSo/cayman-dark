# Cayman vb dark Theme

[![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/oSoWoSo/cayman-vb-black/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg?branch=my)](https://github.com/oSoWoSo/cayman-vb-black/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)

*cayman vb dark is an adaptation of the Cayman Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages.*

You can preview the theme at [https://cayman.osowoso.xyz](https://cayman.osowoso.xyz).

This uses [Dark Reader](https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader) as a base for the theme, and makes some much-needed tweaks to make the colors more cohesive.

## Usage

To use the Cayman-Dark theme with Github Pages, add the following to your site's `_config.yml`:

```yml
remote_theme: oSoWoSo/cayman-vb-dark
```

## Original Theme
You can learn more about the underlying theme at [https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman)

Cayman-Dark is a fork of Cayman thus inherits its functionality. An example is shown below but there is more information at the Cayman repository (see above)

### Configuration variables

Cayman will respect the following variables, if set in your site's `_config.yml`:

```yml
title: [The title of your site]
description: [A short description of your site's purpose]
```

Additionally, you may choose to set the following optional variables:

```yml
show_downloads: ["true" or "false" to indicate whether to provide a download URL]
google_analytics: [Your Google Analytics tracking ID]
```

## Changes
A list of changes I have made from the original theme due to my own personal preference
 - Removed "generated by Github pages footer"
 - Removed "skip to content button"
